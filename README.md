# p4Thesis2021
This repo os designed to track every step of my P4 thesis.
Some example of clones to kick off the repo:
[**basic ingress-2-egress**](./clone_examples/basic/) - this first example is a 3 hosts, 1 switch network that clones every packet exchanged between h1 and h2 to h3. The clone happens between the ingress and egress queue.
[**basic egress-2-egress**](./clone_examples/basic_e2e/) - this first example is a 3 hosts, 1 switch network that clones every packet exchanged between h1 and h2 to h3.The clone happens between the egress and egress queue.
